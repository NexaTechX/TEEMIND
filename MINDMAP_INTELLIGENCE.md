## 🎯 **Smart Detection System**

Your AI now intelligently determines when to generate mind maps based on the complexity and nature of the user's question.

### ✅ **Mind Maps ARE Generated For:**

#### 🏗️ **Complex Problems**
- Multi-step technical implementations
- System architecture planning
- Business strategy development
- Project planning and execution
- Process workflows and methodologies

#### 💼 **Business Questions**
- "How can Gtext expand into new markets?"

- "Create a media workflow automation system"
- "What's the best tech stack for our MVP?"

#### 📚 **Learning & Development**
- "What's your approach to learning new technologies?"
- "How do I become a better developer?"

- "Are you Nigerian?"
- "How's your day going?"

#### 📖 **Basic Definitions**

- Decision-making adds another layer of intelligence

## 🎯 **Examples**

### **Complex Question → Mind Map Generated**
```
User: "How should I build a real estate CRM for Gtext Land?"

Response: Detailed explanation + comprehensive mind map showing:
- Requirements Analysis
- Technical Architecture
- Implementation Phases
- Database Design
